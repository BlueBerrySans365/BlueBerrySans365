Hello, I'm Nick (or Nick P. irl, some of my friends know this)  
I was a lil programmer. 
Started with a discord bot on python with my old friend, who then took everything after bot was verified. (After Heroku disabled all free hosting he said that he will sell it, bot named NexChan)  
After that - I forgot about him and this bot, I don't see a future of this bot. 
  
Then, I poorly ported HMtai, package that my dear, old friend, Mikun did, to python package.  
I did it, now it's archived, but you can fork and then do whatever you want with this.  
  
So... After so much time before and after war started I tought that I lost interest in this.  
It wasn't an accurate feeling, but it just was the start.  
  
After much of failed projects that not even was posted here... I don't know what to do now  
I don't see myself as a programmer  
  
I think, I lost interest in coding.  
  
This is not even a f**king joke.  
Thanks for everything guys.    
  
  
  
  
  
Now, I'll see how bad my rank will go.
